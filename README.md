LOLFF15 is a **Telegram Bot** and **Windows application (no installation required)** that sends you a warning message when a League of Legends game starts. 

This way you will be able too safely move away from your computer an return before something horrible happens.

3. Download the Windows Executable (no installation required) from: [https://github.com/j4n7/lolff15/blob/master/dist/LOLFF15.exe](https://github.com/j4n7/lolff15/blob/master/dist/LOLFF15.exe)

4. Open LOLFF15 Windows application. You will need to configure it if it is the first time you open it.

5. Follow the steps prompted by the application. Add your LOL summoner name and then use the Telegram Bot to receive the code you will need to input. You will need to send your Summoner name with the Telegram Bot using the following code: **/summonner *player_name*** For example:

## How it works

LOLFF15 uses [Riot Live Client Data API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#game-client-api_live-client-data-api) which provides a way to gather information from an active League of Legends game that is running locally in your computer. 

It is not gathering information from a remote source, that is why you won't be able to access a game outside your computer.

## Will my LOL account get banned for using LOLFF15?
LOLFF15 only uses information that Riot makes directly available for you via their API and it doesn't give you any unfair advantage in the game. That should make it Riot compliant.

That being said, this is a third party application that is not maintained by Riot. Use it at your own risk.
